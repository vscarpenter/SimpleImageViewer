## Version Comparison Test Matrix

### Supported Version Formats
| Format | Example | Supported | Notes |
|--------|---------|-----------|-------|
| Semantic | 1.0.0 | ✅ | Standard format |
| Short | 1.0 | ✅ | Auto-padded |
| Single | 1 | ✅ | Auto-padded |
| Build Info | 1.0 (Build 1) | ✅ | Build info ignored |
| Pre-release | 1.0.0-beta | ✅ | Proper ordering |
| Marketing | Version 1.0 | ✅ | Prefix stripped |
| Git Tag | v1.0.0 | ✅ | Prefix stripped |
| Windows | 1.0.0.0 | ✅ | Four-part versions |
| Invalid | "invalid" | ✅ | Graceful handling |

### Version Comparison Edge Cases
- Empty versions (treated as 0.0.0)
- Leading zeros (normalized)
- Pre-release identifiers (proper semantic ordering)
- Build metadata (ignored per semantic versioning)
- Mixed formats (best-effort comparison)

## User Workflow Test Scenarios

### 1. First Install Workflow
1. App launches with no stored version
2. What's New popup appears automatically
3. User views and dismisses popup
4. Version is stored in UserDefaults
5. Subsequent launches don't show popup

### 2. Version Upgrade Workflow
1. App launches with stored old version
2. What's New popup appears for new version
3. User dismisses popup
4. New version is stored
5. Help menu access still works

### 3. Help Menu Workflow
1. User accesses What's New via Help menu
2. Sheet is presented with current content
3. User dismisses sheet
4. Automatic popup state is updated
5. Content remains accessible via Help menu

### 4. Error Recovery Workflow
1. Corrupted UserDefaults data detected
2. System defaults to showing What's New (fail-safe)
3. User dismisses popup
4. Valid data is restored
5. Normal operation resumes
