   - ✅ Colors automatically adapt to system appearance changes

2. **Navigation Controls Dark Mode Support**
   - ✅ NavigationControlsView uses adaptive colors
   - ✅ Toolbar background and text colors work in both modes
   - ✅ Image counter and zoom indicators visible in dark mode

3. **Image Info Overlay Dark Mode Support**
   - ✅ ImageInfoOverlayView uses system-appropriate colors
   - ✅ Text overlays have sufficient contrast in both modes
   - ✅ Loading indicators use adaptive colors

4. **Folder Selection Dark Mode Support**
   - ✅ FolderSelectionView background gradients use adaptive colors
   - ✅ Button colors and text are visible in both modes
   - ✅ Recent folders section uses system-appropriate colors

5. **Comprehensive Dark Mode Testing**
   - ✅ DarkModeUITests.swift validates all components
   - ✅ VisualRegressionTests.swift captures screenshots for comparison
   - ✅ ColorAdaptiveTests.swift validates color system functionality

### 🔍 App Store Rejection Scenario Validation:

**Original Issue:** "UI visibility problems in Dark mode"

**Resolution Verified:**
- All UI elements are now visible and readable in Dark mode
- System colors ensure proper contrast ratios
- Appearance switching works seamlessly during runtime
- No hardcoded colors that break in Dark mode

## 2. Window Management Compliance (Requirement 4.2)

### ✅ Tests Passed:

1. **App Delegate Implementation**
   - ✅ AppDelegate.swift implements NSApplicationDelegate
   - ✅ Window reference management and lifecycle handling
   - ✅ applicationShouldHandleReopen method for dock icon behavior
   - ✅ showMainWindow method to restore hidden windows

2. **Window Menu System**
   - ✅ Window menu added to main menu bar
   - ✅ "Show Main Window" menu item with Cmd+N shortcut
   - ✅ Menu action handlers for window management
   - ✅ Menu items properly enabled/disabled based on state

3. **Window Delegate Implementation**
   - ✅ WindowDelegate class conforming to NSWindowDelegate
   - ✅ windowShouldClose overridden to hide instead of close
   - ✅ Window state tracking for visibility management
   - ✅ Proper window restoration when reopened

4. **Window State Management**
   - ✅ WindowState model for saving window frame and app state
   - ✅ WindowStateManager for state persistence
   - ✅ Integration with PreferencesService
   - ✅ Window frame and folder state restoration

5. **Comprehensive Window Management Testing**
   - ✅ WindowManagementIntegrationTests.swift validates complete workflow
   - ✅ AppDelegateTests.swift tests delegate functionality
   - ✅ WindowStateManagerTests.swift validates state persistence

### 🔍 App Store Rejection Scenario Validation:

**Original Issue:** "Missing window management functionality"

**Resolution Verified:**
- Window closes hide the app instead of terminating it
- Clear ways to reopen hidden windows (dock icon, menu, keyboard shortcut)
- Follows macOS Human Interface Guidelines for window behavior
- App continues running when main window is closed

## 3. macOS Human Interface Guidelines Compliance (Requirement 4.3)

### ✅ Validated Guidelines:

1. **Window Behavior Predictability**
   - ✅ Window close behavior is consistent with macOS standards
   - ✅ App continues running when window is closed
   - ✅ Multiple ways to restore hidden windows

2. **Menu System Standards**
   - ✅ Window menu follows macOS conventions
   - ✅ Standard menu item naming ("Show Main Window")
   - ✅ Proper keyboard shortcuts (Cmd+N)

3. **Dock Integration**
   - ✅ Dock icon clicking restores hidden windows
   - ✅ App activation follows macOS patterns

4. **Window State Persistence**
   - ✅ Window frame and position are preserved
   - ✅ Previous folder selection and image position restored

## 4. macOS Version Compatibility (Requirement 4.4)

### ✅ Compatibility Verified:

1. **Target macOS Versions**
   - ✅ Minimum: macOS 12.0 (Monterey)
   - ✅ Recommended: macOS 13.0+
   - ✅ Current testing: macOS 15.5

2. **Framework Compatibility**

   - ✅ System color APIs available on target versions
   - ✅ Window management APIs supported

3. **Build Configuration**
   - ✅ Universal Binary (Intel x86_64 + Apple Silicon arm64)
   - ✅ Proper deployment target settings
   - ✅ Code signing and entitlements configured

## 5. Existing Functionality Integrity (Requirement 4.5)

### ✅ Functionality Preserved:

1. **Core Image Viewing**
   - ✅ Image loading and display unchanged
   - ✅ Navigation between images works correctly
   - ✅ Zoom and pan functionality intact

2. **Folder Management**
   - ✅ Folder scanning and selection preserved
   - ✅ Recent folders functionality maintained
   - ✅ File system integration unchanged

3. **User Preferences**
   - ✅ Settings persistence works correctly
   - ✅ User preferences maintained across sessions
   - ✅ No data loss during window state management

4. **Performance**
   - ✅ No performance regression from new features
   - ✅ Memory management remains efficient
   - ✅ App launch time unchanged

## Build and Test Results
